# Number-match
A simple game where you have to make each square equal to a certain number. 

For example make all the top left squre numbers equal to 2. So an example of a solution is:

3 3 3   6 6 6   7 7 7
3 3 3   6 6 6   7 7 7
3 3 3   6 6 6   7 7 7

1 1 1   5 5 5   2 2 2
1 1 1   5 5 5   2 2 2
1 1 1   5 5 5   2 2 2

8 8 8   9 9 9   4 4 4
8 8 8   9 9 9   4 4 4
8 8 8   9 9 9   4 4 4

You Can move the rows and columns left, right, up or down.

You do this by specifying the letter or number of the row  or column

Then specify if you want to move right, left, up or down by writing r, l, u or d

So to move row a to the right you would type ar for example.

You can also press i to see valid inputs.

There is nothing to complicated about this program but it was one of the first games I leant to make before learning how to use GUIs. and Thought it would be good to show as it is a fun puzzzle and I enjoyed playing around with this puzzle when I was younger.

Can you sole it?
Is it solvable for any randomly generated set of numbers?
And can you find a general algorythm to solve this?
